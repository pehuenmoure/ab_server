        <p><b>Major: </b>Mechanical Engineering</p>
        <p><b>Year: </b>Junior '18</p>
        <p>I joined the team at the beginning of summer 2016 and worked on the front motor to help the bike balance. This past semester, I was the systems sub-team lead, during which I worked on gathering data from our various sensors and giving the balance controller the information it needs to balance. More generally I am a junior interested in robotics, mechatronics and controls. I also am in Sigma Pi fraternity on campus, and I rowed for a year for the Cornell lightweights. I enjoy playing various sports and being outside when I'm not working on the bike!</p>
